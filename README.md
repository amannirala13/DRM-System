This is a novel DRM solution being built as a research project at VIT, Vellore.

The repository contains the code and documentation for a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system designed to protect digital content and ensure secure access. The DRM system aims to address the growing need for robust content protection in various digital media, including software, documents, and multimedia files. By integrating both hardware and software components, the DRM system provides a multi-layered security approach. The hardware module can be connected via GPIO or serial connection to interface with the system‚Äôs CPU, ensuring that only authorized hardware configurations can access the protected content. Additionally, the software components include secure executable generation and validation scripts, which embed unique security identifiers into digital files, preventing unauthorized use and distribution. This project represents an innovative step towards enhancing digital content security through a combination of encryption, user authentication, and rights management.

# üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to use?

Using the DRM solution needs both hardware and software configurations. This guide will help you set up your system to test the DRM solution.

First, we need to set up the **DRM sub-module**. Typically it's simply interfacing the DRM kit with the GPIO of the system or making a serial connection with the CPU (depending on which model you opt for).

## ‚û¨ GPIO Connection Guide

TODO: Provide the GPIO guide

## ‚û¨ Serial Connection Guide

TODO: Provide the Serial guide

After connecting and testing the hardware, you can install the device driver or boot the system with the compatible kernel. *Check the kernel logs to verify if the DRM sub-system is connected properly*.

After this setup is completed, software distributors need to register with our secured servers to start using the CI/CD services for on-demand secure file generation and delivery.

## üîí Embedding executable with security identifier

You will be using the `secure_id.py` for generating the secured executable from a regular executable. The script accepts two parameters the first parameter is the current executable path and the second is the secured executable path which it will generate.

Example:

``````shell
python secure_id mytest.exec ./secured/mytest.exec
``````

This will generate a new file at `./secured/mytest.exec`.

This Python file can be used to generate executables for your platform and added to the env path for direct terminal access and CI/CD integration.

The osX binaries are provided in the repository with the `secure_exe` and `secure_id` which can be used to perform secured execution and generate secured executables respectively.

## üèÉüèª Securely executing the file

This section utilizes the exclusive syscalls in the supported kernels that identify the secured executables and check for their validity before the executable is loaded in the memory. In this repository, you are provided with a Python script `secure_exe.py` for proof of concept

which includes the near-the-truth implementation of the algorithm inside the extended system call in the kernel.

The `secure_exe.py` accepts one parameter which is the path of the secured executable that needs to be executed.

Example:

``````shell
python secure_exe ./secured/mytest.exec
``````

Now if the secured executable was built for your system, it will be loaded in the memory and executed, else it will be blocked from loading and an exception will be raised.

## Verifying the integrity of the license

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the license agreement, all releases are digitally signed. You can verify the digital signature using the [public key](https://github.com/amannirala13/DRM-System/blob/main/public_key.pem) provided in this repository.

### Prerequisites

To verify the signature, you will need:
- OpenSSL installed on your system. You can check if it's already installed by running `openssl version` in your terminal. If not, please refer to [OpenSSL's official documentation](https://www.openssl.org/) for installation instructions.
- The public key file ([`public_key.pem`](https://github.com/amannirala13/DRM-System/blob/main/public_key.pem)) from this repository.
- The signature file ([`signature.sig`](https://github.com/amannirala13/DRM-System/blob/main/signature.sig)) provided alongside the release.
- The original file you wish to verify ([`LICENSE.md`](https://github.com/amannirala13/DRM-System/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).

### Steps to Verify

1. **Download the Public Key**:
   Download `public_key.pem` from the repository to your local machine.

2. **Download the Signature File**:
   Download `signature.sig`, the signature file for the document or software you wish to verify.

3. **Verify the Signature**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files. Run the following command to verify the signature:

   ```bash
   openssl dgst -sha256 -binary LICENSE.md | openssl pkeyutl -verify -pubin -inkey public_key.pem -sigfile signature.sig
   ```
